Scheduling for new classes at MSOE can be somewhat confusing and stressful. 
In this article, I want to quickly share a few tips and tricks I've learned from my time here at school.

## Scheduling

Right around week seven or eight, you'll receive your scheduling time in [MyMSOE](https://my.msoe.edu). 

Sometimes, you'll get a late scheduling time, which means you may not be able to get all of the classes you want. 
Unfortunately, you don't really have a lot of control over this process. 
Your advisor might tell you that your registration time is dependent on how many credits you have, and that people are filtered into buckets based on their academic standing. 
However, the truth is that you're probably scheduling late because of a loose cosmic ray that flipped your credit count from 60 to -127, or because Mercury is in retrograde, or because you forgot to sacrifice a goat to the registrar during week 6.

If you're really lucky, you'll get an early scheduling date. 
This means that instead of having to compete with the rest of your class to land one of eighteen available seats for a class, you get to compete with half of your class to land one of eight seats that the registrar decided to open up. 

In either case, you might try to schedule and find that one of the classes you want is full. 
If this happens, don't worry!
You have a lot of options at this point:

- File a closed section request: This form asks a department to put you in a class that's already full. This is a great way to practice coping with rejection emails from your internship applications!
- Schedule for an open section: You may have to put in some extra work to do well in a class with a more difficult professor, but hey, at the end of the day they're all fair in the end, right?
- Wait for the section to open up: Seats can *always* be added to sections. In my experience, more seats tend to be added at times ending in a prime number, like 8:07 AM or 12:67 PM.

## What happens if I don't get get my schedule?

If a class is a requirement in your academic track, then the school is required to give you a seat. 
In this case, a closed section request filed when all section are full will usually be approved without issue. This can be acutally be a good thing, because an 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM schedule is actually really good because it's a realistic simulation of a real work day in industry!

If you end up with a really bad schedule, learning new skills can help you cope with the reality you're studying for finals already dreading the next term!

As of right now, I'm not feeling all that good about my schedule for the fall. 
To distract us, let's learn how to build a simple web scraper together!

## web scraping

Web scraping is a way of programatically retrieving data or content from a website. 
We can use these techniques to automatically extract the static HTML data from a website, and with it, potentially database contents that gets served alongside the static website.  

For our little application, I'm going to just pick a [random website](https://resources.msoe.edu/sched/courses/all) that we can easily pull some data off of.
