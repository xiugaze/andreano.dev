### how
{{< repo >}}

{{</ repo >}}

I made this website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The icons are from [Feather](https://feathericons.com/), and there's a little bit of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) here and there for buttons and stuff. Colors are from [Ros√© Pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/rose-pine-theme). 

Anything dynamic I made from scratch with raw JavaScript (no `jQuery`, no bloat).
### why
The only way to have true free speech online is to host and post on your own website.
