# about this website 

This website pretty much mine.
It is built using my custom static site generator tailored to exactly what I need, no more, no less.
It's served by a dead-simple web server that I wrote, behind a caddy reverse proxy on a machine on my LAN.
I run my DNS through Cloudflare with the orange cloud.

I used to build it through Hugo and serve through github pages but I didn't like that very much because I didn't really understand what was going on behind the scenes.
