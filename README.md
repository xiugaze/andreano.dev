# andreano.dev

this is [my site](https://www.andreano.dev) what

- custom static site generator (garbage, barely works, don't use)
- deployable as a nixos module (rebuilds like 3 derivations on any change, deployments take like 20 minutes)
- runs as a system service on my homelab (insecure, exposes my public ip, etc)
- not posix compliant

  this whole repo should be one (1) shell script
