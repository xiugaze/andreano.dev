        Formula Hybrid is one of the SAE collegiate design competitions. Our
        team builds a formula style hybrid racecar and competes in a bunch of
        static and dynamic events. This season was our first year in a two-year
        design cycle for our car, the MP6. We designed and manufactured the
        chassis and drivetrain from scratch this year with a new IC engine,
        redesigned the high-voltage and low-voltage systems, and used the first
        iteration of a new software stack to control the MP6's powertrain and
        other subsystems. I had the opportunity this year to work as the design
        lead for the software team, and we worked on a new codebase
        prioritizing real-time performance and asynchronous execution using

        In summary, we were the only hybrid team to pass all inspections and
        move under our own power. We won first place for project management,
        second in design, and first overall for the hybrid category. I'm super
        proud of the work we did this year, and what follows is a day-by day of
        the competition from my end.
